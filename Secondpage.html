            Our sales will eventually blow up according to our business plan.  
        Because we are just about to release better retail, and specific 
        kits for specific people.  And once more people know about healthful,
         itâ€™ll spread, gaining popularity.  We also plan on going worldwide, 
        which is our biggest plan overall.  Since we already have our stores in 
        the US, we think it will be our best selling country. Since the world is so 
        big it will make our sales explode giving many people the first aid kits 
        they deserve. This will make our sales in 2025 $20,000,000. This means
         our company will grow to the next level. 
        </p>

            Our strength is that we have a special button to call the 
            police which is way faster that calling through your phone.  
            Our weakness is that we are not currently worldwide, but 
            we plan to do that, and becoming local.  We have an opportunity
             to have better retail, and going into stores like target, walmart, 
            and many other stores.  Cintas, SafetyMax, and RedCross are 
            doing good first aid kits.  RedCross is our main counter, but we 
            do have a better product because we have waterproof bandaids, 
            infection cleaning, sprays, and much more.
